# Rear Window

Rear Window, originally called "Photo Browser" (not so original), is an app that allows users to connect to Unsplash's API, browse through their most popular, latest photos and also search photos by term.

This app is an MVP(minimum viable product) built with the intention of future expansion. It was designed to work in both dark and light modes and also in both orientations: portrait and landscape.

The source code was written in Swift 5, using OOP principles and following the MVC design pattern.
